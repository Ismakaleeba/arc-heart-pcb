# ARC-Heart PCB Virtual Design Workspace

This repository contains the virtual design environment for the ARC-Heart PCB project. It includes KiCad schematic templates, PCB layout files, continuous integration workflows, and automation scripts to streamline hardware development and collaboration.

## Repository Structure

- **/docs** — Design documentation and references  
- **/kicad** — KiCad project files including schematics and PCB layouts  
- **/scripts** — Automation tools such as BOM generators  
- **/.github** — GitHub workflows, issue and pull request templates  

## Features

- Standardized KiCad templates for Power and MCU sections  
- Automated Bill of Materials (BOM) generation with GitHub Actions  
- Continuous integration for design rule checks and export validation  
- Collaboration guidelines via issue and pull request templates  

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ismakaleeba/arc-heart-pcb.git
